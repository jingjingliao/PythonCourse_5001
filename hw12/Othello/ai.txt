* Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
    Yes, I use sorted function to rank the dictionary based on the value's length, which means there are more disks that need to be 
    flipped over

* If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
    I have already accomplished this, and computer player is very smart now

* How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
    I have the following variables
    self.black_color = 0 
    self.white_color = 255
    self.color = 0
    and besides, I have the color change function
    def change_color(self):
        """Change the color of the disk"""
        if self.color == self.black_color:
            self.color = self.white_color
        else:
            self.color = self.black_color
    so when black disk moves, the self.color will become white color and when white disk move, the self.color 
    will be changed to the black disk

* How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
    If it is the first time to play this game, actually, it's really hard for human to win. But if you can find out the pattern
    it's easier to win later
    
* How would you improve it in the future?
    Deep learning can make the game smarter as it will calculate each step of computers, and human's and the probability of the 
    success times, then human hardly win. I may change my code after I learned machine learning course
